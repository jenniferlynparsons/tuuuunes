# Tuuunes

A modern music library manager combining iTunes 11's superior information architecture with iTunes 12's visual design.

## Project Overview

- **Powerful Playback**: Full-featured audio player with 10-band equalizer
- **Beautiful Views**: Library list, album gallery with blurred backgrounds, and custom playlists
- **Metadata Editing**: Edit track info, batch editing, and artwork management
- **Fast Search**: Global search across your library with advanced filters

## Tech Stack

- **Electron**: Native desktop application framework
- **React**: Modern UI components and state management
- **SQLite**: Fast, local database for metadata
- **Web Audio API**: High-quality audio playback and effects

## Platform

- macOS (primary target)
- Cross-platform potential for future releases

## Development Status

Currently in planning phase. See the [project plan](project plan/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md) for detailed implementation roadmap.

### Development Phases

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Infrastructure, database, import, basic UI shell
2. **Phase 2: Playback Core** - Audio engine, queue management, playback controls
3. **Phase 3: Views Implementation** - Library list, album gallery, playlist management
4. **Phase 4: Polish & Features** - EQ, metadata editing, search, visual polish
5. **Phase 5: Edge Cases & Optimization** - Performance, error handling, production readiness

## Getting Started

Documentation for setup and development will be added as the project progresses.

## Why Tuuunes?

Modern streaming services are great, but sometimes you want full control over your music library. Tuuunes is being built for people who:

- Own their music files and want a great way to organize them
- Miss the information architecture of iTunes 11
- Want a lightweight, focused music player
- Prefer local libraries over streaming services
